# MLift
This is a Weight Lifting Challenge app using Machine Learning.

## Overview
<p>The app uses a camera to recognize the user's movements (currently only capable of detecting squats) and conducts Challenges based on those movements (e.g., the number of squats to be performed daily over a certain period of time).</p>

## Configuration
<p>MLift consists of three applications:</p>

- <strong>MLift:</strong> A Progressive Web App (PWA) used to register and manage user-specific IDs and Challenge information. It can be accessed from iPhones, Android devices, and PCs, and can also be installed as a separate app on iPhones and Android devices.
- <strong>qr_code:</strong> A separate PC application used to log in via a QR code, which carries the user information set in the MLift app.<br>
- <strong>pushups:</strong> An application that receives the login information from the qr_code app and performs the actual Weight Lifting Challenge. It currently only recognizes the squat movement, but can be trained to recognize multiple movements.

### MLift
The MLift application is built with Python, Django, and Django Rest API. Except for the pushups_main and for_readme folders in this repository, all other folders and files are part of this application.

### qr_code
The qr_code app is developed using JavaScript. It reads the user-specific QR codes generated by the MLift app and handles the login process. It can be run on Raspberry Pi, PCs, and Macs as long as a web browser and camera are available. The files for this app can be found in the qr_code folder inside the pushups_main folder.

### pushups
The pushups app is developed using JavaScript. It receives the login information from the qr_code app (specifically, it recognizes the updated user information in the database) and identifies the user. Based on this information, it recognizes the "squat" movement captured by the camera and conducts the challenge. The squat movement recognition is achieved using OpenCV and Tensorflow for classification algorithms. The code that handles the recognition of Idle/Squat states and counts the repetitions can be found in the pushups folder inside the pushups_main folder.
